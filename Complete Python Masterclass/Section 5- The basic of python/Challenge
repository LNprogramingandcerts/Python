# Write a small program to ask for a name and an age.
# When both values have been entered, check if the person
# is the right age to go on an 18-30 holiday (they must be
# over 18 and under 31).
# If they are, welcome them to the holiday, otherwise print
# a (polite) message refusing them entry.


My python code:
name = input("What is your name?")
age = int(input("How old are you?"))

if age > 31 or age <= 18:
    print("Sorry your are not old enough to go on the hoilday trip")
else:
    print(" Welcome to club 18_30 holiday trip.")
