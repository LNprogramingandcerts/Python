Storing strings into different variables

Python Code:
greeting = "Bruce"
_myName = 'Tim'
Tim45 = "Good"
Tim_Was_57 = "Hello"
Greeting = "There"
print(Tim_Was_57 +' ' + greeting)

Errors with printing strings with integers
Python Code:
age = 24
print(age)

print(greeting + age)



Learning the difference between float and integers

a = 12
b = 3
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a//b)
*// returns a whole number*
print(a%b)

Running loops in python:
for i in range(1,a/b):
    print(i)

Would return error with lather code

Code without the error:
for i in range(1,a//b):
    print(i)
