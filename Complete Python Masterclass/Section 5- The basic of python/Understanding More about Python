Make use of the spiltString and tabString characters
 Python Code:
 splitString = "This string has been \nsplit over\nseveral\nlines"
print(splitString)

tabbedString = "1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t"
print(tabbedString)

Python Results:

This string has been 
split over
several
lines
1	2	3	4	5	

Making use of single quotes and double quotes in the same code
Python:Code
print('The pet shop owner said "No, no, \'e\'s uh,...he\s ressting"' )
print("The pet shop owner said \"No, no, 'e's uh,... he's resting\"")

Python: Results
The pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's uh,...he\s ressting"
The pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's uh,... he's resting"

splitting string without using slashes in the code

Python:Code
anotherSplitString = """This string has been

print(anotherSplitString)

Python:Result
This string has been

Using triple single and double quotes in a code
Python Code:
print('''The pet shop owner said"No,no, 'e's' uh,... he's resting"''')
print("""THe pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's' uh,... he's resting" """)

Python Result:
The pet shop owner said"No,no, 'e's' uh,... he's resting"
THe pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's' uh,... he's resting"
